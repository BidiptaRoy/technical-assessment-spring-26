## Requirements
Please check off which features you have implemented:
- [✓] A catchy name and title with a cool font!
- [✓] An interesting and beautiful frontend design with a catchy title and cool fonts and colors that looks good on any screen size.
- [✓] A home page with a summary about the interesting thing you want to teach me about. I was originally planning for this to be purely academic (e.g. math, CS, physics, engineering) topics but I am expanding it to include anything. However, you should be able to teach about whatever you choose in a clear way and go in-depth about it. If your subject matter is particularly engaging, that will reflect positively on your application.
- [✓] Extra pages with more detailed information on certain topics. Make your website intuitive to navigate through, both within the pages themselves and in your choice of pages. You can structure your website however you see fit.
- [✓] A poll/quiz feature where you can check that the user is aborbing the information your website teaches about well. These quiz questions should be scattered throughout the website, and they should tell the user whether they got the answer right or not once they select it. Additionally, it should show a live count of results (like a social media poll) with the names of the users who have voted for each option. You should take time to make sure your UI for this component is intuitive to use while still including all of the features listed. A user should be able to change their result if they want, and this should be reflected in the result count.
- [✓] A comment feature on each page where users can offer feedback or ask questions based on the lesson on the page. The home page does not need a comment section, but every other page should have one.
- [✓] Deploy the frontend and backend if you can using some of the free deployment tools we talked about in the workshops!

## Written Portion
1. **How did the project go? What parts of it did you most enjoy / find yourself good at?**

The project went well over the past four days and with the help of LLMs. The part of the project I most enjoyed was writing the description for each chokehold/bjj move and the mistakes that people usually make based off of my own experience. I have a passion in the sport and thus it came easily to me. In addition, I found myself particularly good at coordinating activities with LLMs as well as debugging large amounts of code. 

2. **Was this technical assessment what you expected? If you had another two weeks to work on it, what would you add or change?**

The technical assessment was longer than I expected, and would not have been timely possible without some help from LLMs like chatgpt. If I were to have another two weeks to work on it, I would add features like flashcard mode (to help users study), BU login infomration to make this only avaiable to BU students, instructional videos from myself included in the web app demonstrating each move, as well as an interactive map that shows all Jiu jitsu places in the Boston area.
